# Building-Customer-Segmentation-Model-using-Python

In this project, we delve deep into the thriving sector of __online retail__ by analyzing a __transactional dataset__ from a UK-based retailer, available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). This dataset documents all transactions between 2010 and 2011. Our primary objective is to amplify the efficiency of marketing strategies and boost sales through __customer segmentation__. We aim to transform the transactional data into a customer-centric dataset by creating new features that will facilitate the segmentation of customers into distinct groups using the __K-means clustering__ algorithm. This segmentation will allow us to understand the distinct __profiles__ and preferences of different customer groups. Building upon this, we intend to develop a __recommendation system__ that will suggest top-selling products to customers within each segment who haven't purchased those items yet, ultimately enhancing marketing efficacy and fostering increased sales.
